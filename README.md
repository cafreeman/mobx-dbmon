# mobx-dbmon

This app is intended to serve as a benchmark for React + Mobx using the dbmon benchmark.

Prior work on dbmon can be found [here](https://github.com/mathieuancelin/js-repaint-perfs).

Live demo can be found [here](http://mobx-dbmon.surge.sh/)

To run this demo:

- clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run compile`
- open `dist/index.html` (preferably in an incognito window so your extensions don't mess with things).
